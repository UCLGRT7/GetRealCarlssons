# Parent Issue: Implement ParentClass with Default Parameters

This parent issue tracks the implementation of the `ParentClass` and its default parameters. Below are the sub-issues (tasks) required for completion:

## Sub-Issues

- **Subtask 1**: Implement Constructor with Default Parameters  
  **Description**: Implement the constructor for `ParentClass` with the following default parameters:
  - `int id = 0`
  - `string name = "DefaultName"`
  - `bool isActive = true`

---

Each of these subtasks can be tracked as separate issues, and they'll roll up to the parent issue for tracking progress.
